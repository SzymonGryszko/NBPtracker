# NBPTracker
NBPTracker is an android app utilizing [NBP Web API](http's://api.nbp.pl/).

The app was created as a demo project, to showcase my Java/android programming skills</br>
User can check currency exchange rate from USD/GBP/EUR/CHF/RUB to PLN as well as check last 30 gold prices.


Retrofit2 with GSON was used to retrieve data from the web service, which was then displayed using [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) or RecyclerView.
